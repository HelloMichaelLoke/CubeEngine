	\section*{Preamble}
	This file is part of the Voxel Engine project. It is here to document the project, and to explain how the program was conceived.
	It is not a formal scientific paper, but we should try to stick to this style, to make it more readable and interesting.
	Thank you for your attention, have a nice reading.

	\section{Abstract}
	In order to store our voxels, we need a data structure.
	As the software should be dealing with million of blocks, this data structure has to be `memory-friendly', or the whole program won't be able to run.
	That is what `Terrain' are: a data structure.
	\newline
	The approach assumes that we need to store in RAM informations about each loaded blocks, not less, not more.
	These informatons are numerous: block behaviour (transparency, liquid, density, light emitter...), block rendering (lighting, mesh
	\newline
	Final results were definetly acceptable: the programs need 4 bytes per block.
	On a 1GB virtual machine, this would mean being able to fastly access more than 250 000 000 blocks.
	(which is the number of water drop on a $20m^3$ container.)

		\subsection{Memory representation}
			\subsubsection{Naive approach}
				Each blocks need attributes: textures, densities, light value, materials, amount of water...											\newline
				If we store each blocks in it own instance with these attributes, the amount of memory per block (in bytes) would be:
				\[S_{b}=pointer + textures + density + light value + ... >= 40 \textrm{ bytes}\]
				where:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item pointer: pointer to the block memory address (8 bytes)
					\item textures: textures integer id for each block faces (6 faces * 4 bytes per faces)
					\item density: float 4 bytes
					\item light value: float 4 bytes
					\item [...] and many other imagineable attributes.
				\end{itemize}
				However, many blocks \underline{shares constants attributes}. (each `stone' block have the same density for example)
				\newline
				Moreover, Most of the block (> 80\% of them) will be dirt, stone, leaves...
				These blocks have many shared constants attributes. So, \underline{instancing is the key}.
				\newline
			
			\subsubsection{Instancing}
				Let us seperate blocks in two categories: the one that don't need their own instance A), and the one who need it own 							instances B).
				\newline
				\newline
				In category A, we find for instance: dirt, stone, leaves, logs, plants...
				\newline
				\newline
				Each of these blocks need: 1 integer (which will be codded on 2 bytes in practice), representing the 
				In category B, we find liquids (each blocks has it own amount of liquids), or any dynamic blocks that need it own `per block' 						attributes.
				\newline
				\underline{NB:} B inherits A
			
			\subsubsection{Terrain}
				A `Terrain' simply is a $u*v*w$ 4 bytes-array, which hold blocks. Moreover, it contains a 3 integers `world-relative'
				index $(ix, iy, z)$, so we can change from `Terrain' basis coordinate system to global `World' basis.
				\newline
				TODO: 2D terrain scheme
				\newline
				\newline
				The memory usage of a terrain (which can hold $u*v*w$ block from category A)) is:
				\[S_{t}=4 * u * v * w + o(u*v*w)\]
				where:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item $o(u*v*w)$ is the size of every per-Terrain attributes
				\end{itemize}
				and so, per block:
				\newline
				\[S_{b}=4 + o(1) \simeq4.1 \textrm{ bytes (in practice)}\]							
				\newline
				\newline
				To optimize memory access (reading and writting), the 3 dimensionals array was flattened, see:
